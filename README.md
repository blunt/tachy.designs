# tachy.designs

[Tachy.designs](http://blunt.af/tachy.designs/) is a 1-page template built with [Tachyons](http://www.tachyons.io) and [Unsplash](http://www.unsplash.com)  for [Tachy.Tools](http://tachy.tools).

## What's Tachyons?

[Tachyons](http://www.tachyons.io) is a css toolkit. It's mobile-first 📱, highly-readable 📖 and well documented 📘📙📕. It allows you to build pages and components with as little css as possible using classes.

## And Unsplash?
[Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) is a giant photography community 📷 filled with *free (do whatever you want)* high-resolution photos 🖼️. It is amazing 🙏.

## So why did we build Tachy.Tools?
- We 💓💓💓 Tachyons and want to tell everyone 🌎 about it.
- We want to show what's possible with it without using any custom css. It's frickin impressive 😮😅.
- A lot of designers and developers feel overwhelmed 😰 when they look into Tachyons. Tools like these can help them learn 🤓 and better understand how to get started.
- These tools can serve as starter templates for projects. Tachyons makes it really easy to re-use components ♻️ to extend 🚀 these templates into full sites or products.
- We enjoyed every second spent building these 😄.

## What can I do with these?
Absolutely anything you want! Dissect them with developer tools to learn Tachyons, extend them into full sites or turn them into something else!

## Who built this?
We are [Blunt](http://blunt.af) 😻🐻. A small team that likes to create things that help, challenge, and inspire.
